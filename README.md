**Modifications in this fork**
- Fixed an issue with ordering not appearing in shipstation: including all states rather than only ready shipments.

Done ;)

Spree/ShipStation Integration
==============================

Integrates [ShipStation](http://www.shipstation.com) with [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com). It enables ShipStation to pull shipments from the system and update tracking numbers.

For documentation on the API, see [doc/ShipStationCustomStoreDevGuide.pdf](https://github.com/DynamoMTL/spree_shipstation/blob/master/doc/ShipStationCustomStoreDevGuide.pdf?raw=true)

Configuring Spree
-----------

Add spree_shipstation to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "spree_shipstation"
```

Alternatively you can use the git repo directly:

```ruby
gem "spree_shipstation", git: "git://github.com/DynamoMTL/spree_shipstation.git"
```

Then, run bundler

    $ bundle

Configure the ShipStation API username and password. This can be done in the app's spree initializer

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb
Spree.config do |config|
  if Rails.env.production?
    config.shipstation_username = "brett"
    config.shipstation_password = "hull"
  else
    config.shipstation_username = "jody"
    config.shipstation_password = "hull"
  end

  config.shipstation_weight_units = "Grams" # Grams, Ounces or Pounds

  # choose which number to send shipstation, use :shipment or :order, default is :shipment
  config.shipstation_number = :shipment

  # if you prefer to send notifications via shipstation
  config.send_shipped_email = false
end
```

For deployment on Heroku, you can configure the API username/password with environment variables:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb
Spree.config do |config|
  config.shipstation_username = ENV['SHIPSTATION_USERNAME']
  config.shipstation_password = ENV['SHIPSTATION_PASSWORD']


  config.shipstation_weight_units = "Grams" # Grams, Ounces or Pounds
  config.send_shipped_email = false
end
```

And you can configure them with:

    $ heroku config:set SHIPSTATION_USERNAME=brett SHIPSTATION_PASSWORD=hull

Configuring ShipStation
-----------------------

To do this, go to **Settings** and select **Stores**. Then click **Add Store**, scroll down and choose the **Custom Store** option.

- For **Username**, enter the username defined in your config
- For **Password**, enter the password defined in your config
- For **URL to custom page**, enter the url: `https://domain.tld/shipstation.xml`
- For **Unpaid Status** enter `pending`
- For **Paid Status** enter `ready`
- For **Shipped Status** enter `shipped`
- For **Cancelled Status** enter `cancelled`


Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test_app

To run tests:

    $ bundle exec rspec spec

To run tests with guard (preferred):
    
    $ bundle exec guard


Caveats
-------
- If you change the shipping method of an order in ShipStation, the change will not be reflected in Spree and the tracking link might not work
